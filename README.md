# Search Relevance

### Overview
Search relevance is the measure of accuracy of the relationship between the search query and the search results. Research shows 43% of website visitors go immediately 
to the search bar, and these searchers are about 2-3 times more likely to convert. When users are served results that align to their query and interests, they will be 
more satisfied, more engaged, and even more likely to convert.

### Dataset
Few years back Kaggle hosted a competition, CrowdFlower Search Results Relevance, which had an objective of creating an open-source model that can be used to measure the relevance of search results. In doing so, you'll be helping enable small business owners to match the experience provided by more resource rich competitors. There is approximately 10000 records in the training set, having columns as Query, Product Title, Product Description, Median Relevance, Relevance Variance and there is a test set which contains nearly 22000 records for which we need to set Median Relevance and Relevance Variance.
